## Usage

- `npm install`
- Build and watch styles and templates with `npm run gulp`
- Watch JavaScript bundle with `npm run watch`
- Build JavaScript bundle with `npm run build` (for production)
- Serve locally with `npm run dev`
- Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view your site.


## Serving

Everything in `/public` is static and servable, so you donâ€™t necessarily
need to serve via the included app.coffee in production. But if you do use
app.coffee, be sure to set the environment variable on your server with
`export NODE_ENV=production`. You can change the port in
`/config/production.json`.
